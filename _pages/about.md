I’m Khushbu Pahwa, a Ph.D. student from the Department of Computer Science at Rice University, advised by [Dr. Xia “Ben” Hu](https://cs.rice.edu/~xh37/index.html) and [Dr. Vladimir Braverman](https://profiles.rice.edu/faculty/vladimir-braverman). My research interests include efficient and trustworthy machine learning. I am a strong proponent of the belief that medicine / healthcare can drive innovation in AI, and AI can bring about a revolution in healthcare. My motivation is to drive innovation in healthcare through cutting edge AI by developing robust theoretically grounded algorithms that can be translated to other fields of science as well. 

Before starting my Ph.D. at RICE, I graduated with a Masters in Electrical & Computer Engineering from University of California, Los Angeles. I was fortunate to engage in challenging research projects at UCLA with [Dr. Abeer Alwan](https://www.ee.ucla.edu/abeer-alwan/) (Depression detection from speech while preserving speaker identity), [Dr Dan Ruan](https://bioscience.ucla.edu/people/dan-ruan/) (fast and learnable measurement-conditioned undersampled MR image reconstruction using Diffusion  models), [Dr. Nader Sehatbaksh](https://ssysarch.ee.ucla.edu/nader/) (comprehensively evaluating the adversarial robustness of tiny ML models); and with [Dr. Cho-Jui Hsieh](https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~chohsieh/) (developing computationally efficient gradient based white-box adversarial attack against text transformers).

Previously, I received my bachelor’s degree in Delhi Technological University, where I was awarded the Vice Chancellor Gold Medal for academic and research excellence.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below.
