<!-- I’m Khushbu Pahwa, a Ph.D. student from the Department of Computer Science at Rice University, advised by [Dr. Xia “Ben” Hu](https://cs.rice.edu/~xh37/index.html) and [Dr. Vladimir Braverman](https://profiles.rice.edu/faculty/vladimir-braverman).  -->
I’m Khushbu Pahwa, a recent Masters in Electrical & Computer Engineering Graduate from University of California, Los Angeles.

My research interests include efficient and trustworthy machine learning for foundation models, with special interest towards healthcare applications. I am broadly interested in the domain of Multi-Modal Learning, Robust Deep Learning, and Trustworthy AI

During my time at UCLA, I was fortunate to engage in challenging research projects at UCLA with [Dr. Abeer Alwan](https://www.ee.ucla.edu/abeer-alwan/) (Depression detection from speech while preserving speaker identity - [ **Privacy Preserving ML** ] ), [Dr Dan Ruan](https://bioscience.ucla.edu/people/dan-ruan/) (fast and learnable measurement-conditioned undersampled MR image reconstruction using Diffusion  models [ **Efficient Foundation Model Research using Diffusion Models**]), [Dr. Nader Sehatbaksh](https://ssysarch.ee.ucla.edu/nader/) (comprehensively evaluating the adversarial robustness of tiny ML models - [ **Neural Architecture Search Framework for adversarially robust Tiny-ML Models** ] ); and with [Dr. Cho-Jui Hsieh](https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~chohsieh/) (developing computationally efficient gradient based white-box adversarial attack against text transformers). During the summer of 2022, I interned at Amazon as an Applied Scientist Intern in the AWS Machine Learning Solutions Lab.

Additionally, I have had an incredible opportunity to engage in research works with [Prof. Pengtao Xie](https://pengtaoxie.github.io/), [Prof. Amitava Das](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HYpfhaEAAAAJ&hl=en), [Prof. Sourav Medya](https://souravmedya.github.io/), and [Dr. Manish Gupta](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/gmanish/).


Previously, I received my bachelor’s degree in Delhi Technological University, where I was awarded the Vice Chancellor Gold Medal for academic and research excellence.
