<!-- You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images. -->

    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
